Super simple and short code to estimate how long would it take to that far-away star 
from the perspective of someone inside a ship which moves at 1g according to 
special relativity.

The calculation assumes you accelerate at 1g half the way, then you deaccelerate 
at -1g the second half of the trip. Of course this is only the time it takes for a 
one-way trip.

Usage
-----

Simply do:

        python howlong.py

Enter the distance to the star you want to visit and that's it!
